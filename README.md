## Workflow
* Check that your code works before commiting/pushing it
* Don't commit to master
* Create a branch for each feature you're working on. The branch must be based on the latest version of `master`.
* When you're done working on a feature - create a Pull Request and ask someone to review your code before merging it into `master`.

## Other stuff
There's a postman collection in the root of the project - you can import it (open postman > ctrl + o > drag-n-drop VerySecureBackend.postman_collection.json from project to postman) and send requests to backend to test it. If you update functionality of an endpoint or add a new one - please update the collection.
